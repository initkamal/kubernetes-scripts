- A Service exposes a set of Pods to the network
- A Service assigns a fixed IP to your Pod replicas

> Three main types of service:
  - Cluster IP [ default ]
  - NodePort
  - LoadBalancer 


- Selectors 
    - we configure services using selectors
  
  - Lables are key-value pairs in object metadata
    - app=nginx
    
  - Pods that match selectors become part of the Service
